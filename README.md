# Standalone frameless NodeCG Dashboard
> Fork of [nodecg/dashboard](https://github.com/nodecg/dashboard) modified to run without a window border. See the [original README](https://github.com/nodecg/dashboard/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

## Installation
No releases available currently, although it's pretty easy to build an ASAR package and replace an existing installation of NodeCG Dashboard with this.
